# --- --- --- Python Functions --- --- ---
# There are two kinds of functions in Python.
# Built-in functions that are already provided in Python 
# these are print(), input(), type(), float(), and etc..

# Then the functions we make ourselves that we use.

# In Python we treat built-in function names as new reserved words
# we avoid them as variable names. (DONT USE Print() as our own variable.)

# --- --- --- Function Definition --- --- ---
# In Python a function is a resuable code that takes 
# arguments as input, does some computation and then returns a result/s.

# We define a dunfction using the def reserved word.

# we call the function by using the function name,
# parantheses and arguments in an expression.
