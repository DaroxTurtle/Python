# -- -- -- Web Scraping -- -- --
# When a program or script pretends to be a browser and retrieves
# web pages, looks at those web pages, extracts information, and
# then looks at more web pages.

# Search engines scrape web pages - we call this 'spidering the web'
# or 'web crawling.'

# -- -- -- Why Scrape? -- -- --
# Pull data - particularly social data - who links to who?
# Get your own data back out of some system that has no 'export capability'
# Monitor a site for new information
# Spider the web to make a database for a search engine

# I dont get it lol
